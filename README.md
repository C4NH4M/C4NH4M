I've been interested software and computing for many years but my profession is outside of this world. _Selft taught_ (Sorry about that!) with night schooling way back when. Have an understandings of the following:

|-----------:|----------------------:|-----------:|-----------------:|-----------:|---------:|------:|
| HTML       | PHP                   | Tailwind   | Ubuntu (Linux)   | Apach      | MySQL     | API  |

|            |                       | Twig       |                  |            |           | cURL |

I liked to work on novel ideas and with the size of some of my projects, I had to start using github to handle them effectively. All my repositorys are private unless they have been forked or are tutorials from other repositories. 

I Finally got around to using Github...
