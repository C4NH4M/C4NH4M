I've been interested software and computing for many years but my profession is outside of this world. _Selft taught_ (Sorry about that!) with night schooling way back when. Have an understandings of the following:

I like to work on novel ideas and with the size of some of my projects, I had to start using github to handle them effectively. All my repositories are private unless they have been forked or are tutorials from other repositories, for now.

I Finally got around to using Github...
